## Summary
- Integrated Rails Action Text to enable rich text editing for blog post content
- Migrated from plain text content field to Action Text rich content
- Updated all views and controllers to support rich text display and editing

## Changes
- Added Action Text to the BlogPost model using `has_rich_text :content`
- Removed the plain text `content` column from the blog_posts table
- Updated the blog post form to use `rich_text_area` for content editing
- Modified all blog post views (public and admin) to properly render rich text content
- Updated RSS and Atom feeds to handle Action Text content properly
- Fixed admin search functionality to work with Action Text content
- Resolved all rubocop style issues

## Test Plan
- [ ] Create a new blog post with rich text formatting (bold, italic, links, images)
- [ ] Verify rich text displays correctly on the public blog post page
- [ ] Verify rich text displays correctly on the admin blog post show page
- [ ] Test editing an existing blog post with rich text
- [ ] Confirm RSS and Atom feeds work correctly
- [ ] Test admin search functionality for content within blog posts
