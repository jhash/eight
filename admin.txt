I've successfully created an admin panel for superadmin users with the following features:

1. **ViewComponent Integration** - Added the ViewComponent gem for building reusable UI components

2. **Admin Controllers** - Created `Admin::BaseController` with superadmin authentication and controllers for Users and Roles

3. **Dynamic Components**:
   - `FormFieldComponent` - Automatically renders appropriate form fields based on column type
   - `ModelTableComponent` - Displays model data in responsive tables
   - `SidebarComponent` - Navigation sidebar listing all models

4. **Full CRUD Operations** for both Users and Roles with:
   - Index views with tables
   - Show views with detailed information
   - New/Edit forms with dynamic field rendering
   - Delete functionality

5. **Special Features**:
   - Superadmin toggle on user forms
   - Auto-dismissing flash messages using Stimulus
   - Responsive Tailwind CSS design
   - Dynamic field rendering that adapts to future model changes

6. **Security** - All admin routes are protected by the `require_superadmin` before action

The changes have been committed and a draft pull request has been created at: https://github.com/jhash/eight/pull/8
